ERROR    10-2.ms3 -- Score contains ambiguous barnumbers at measure count 45, possibly caused by MuseScore's 'Add to bar number' or 'Section break' function.
WARNING  10-2.ms3 -- Voltas with measure COUNTS [[43, 44], [45]] have different lengths.
    Check measure NUMBERS with authoritative score. To silence the warning, either make all voltas
    the same length or exclude all measures in voltas > 1 from the bar count.
