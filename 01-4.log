ERROR    01-4.ms3 -- Score contains ambiguous barnumbers at measure count 59, possibly caused by MuseScore's 'Add to bar number' or 'Section break' function.
WARNING  01-4.ms3 -- Voltas with measure COUNTS [[57, 58], [59, 60, 61]] have different lengths.
    Check measure NUMBERS with authoritative score. To silence the warning, either make all voltas
    the same length or exclude all measures in voltas > 1 from the bar count.
WARNING  01-4.ms3 -- Repeat missing in the last measure.
WARNING  01-4.ms3 -- MCs [60 61] in volta [59, 60, 61] have not been excluded from barcount.
