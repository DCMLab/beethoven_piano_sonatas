DCML_NON_CHORD_TONES_ABOVE_THRESHOLD_WARNING (19, 43, '1/4', 'viio6(+2)/V') ms3.Parse.beethoven_piano_sonatas.02-2
	The label 'viio6(+2)/V' in m. 43, onset 1/4 (MC 43, onset 1/4) seems not to correspond well to the score (which does not necessarily mean it is wrong).
	In the context of D.V, it expresses the scale degrees
	('6', '1', '#4') [('F#', 'A', 'D#')] plus the added ('5',) [('E',)].
	The corresponding score segment has 1 within-label and 3 out-of-label note onsets,
	a ratio of 0.75 > 0.6 (the current, arbitrary, threshold).
	If it turns out the label is correct, please add the header of this warning to the IGNORED_WARNINGS, ideally followed
	by a free-text comment in subsequent lines starting with a space or tab.
DCML_NON_CHORD_TONES_ABOVE_THRESHOLD_WARNING (19, 46, '1/2', 'ii') ms3.Parse.beethoven_piano_sonatas.02-2
	The label 'ii' in m. 46, onset 1/2 (MC 46, onset 1/2) seems not to correspond well to the score (which does not necessarily mean it is wrong).
	In the context of D.I, it expresses the scale degrees
	('2', '4', '6') [('E', 'G', 'B')].
	The corresponding score segment has 2 within-label and 7 out-of-label note onsets,
	a ratio of 0.7777777777777778 > 0.6 (the current, arbitrary, threshold).
	If it turns out the label is correct, please add the header of this warning to the IGNORED_WARNINGS, ideally followed
	by a free-text comment in subsequent lines starting with a space or tab.
