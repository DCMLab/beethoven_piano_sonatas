============================================================

VOLTAS_WITH_DIFFERING_LENGTHS_WARNING (4, 115) ms3.Parse.beethoven_piano_sonatas.02-1
	Volta group of MC 115 contains voltas with different lengths: [4, 8] Check for correct computation of MNs and copy this message into an IGNORED_WARNINGS file to make the warning disappear.
WARNING  ms3.Parse.beethoven_piano_sonatas.02-1
	The startRepeat in MC 127 is missing its endRepeat.
	For correction, MC 342 is interpreted as such because it is the last bar of the piece..
INCORRECT_VOLTA_MN_WARNING (2, 119) ms3.Parse.beethoven_piano_sonatas.02-1
	MC 119, the 1st measure of a 2nd volta, should have MN 113, not MN 114.
INCORRECT_VOLTA_MN_WARNING (2, 120) ms3.Parse.beethoven_piano_sonatas.02-1
	MC 120, the 2nd measure of a 2nd volta, should have MN 113, not MN 115.
INCORRECT_VOLTA_MN_WARNING (2, 121) ms3.Parse.beethoven_piano_sonatas.02-1
	MC 121, the 3rd measure of a 2nd volta, should have MN 113, not MN 116.
INCORRECT_VOLTA_MN_WARNING (2, 122) ms3.Parse.beethoven_piano_sonatas.02-1
	MC 122, the 4th measure of a 2nd volta, should have MN 113, not MN 117.

DCML_NON_CHORD_TONES_ABOVE_THRESHOLD_WARNING (19, 34, '0', 'I') ms3.Parse.beethoven_piano_sonatas.02-1
	The label 'I' in m. 33, onset 0 (MC 34, onset 0) seems not to correspond well to the score (which does not necessarily mean it is wrong).
	In the context of A.I, it expresses the scale degrees
	('1', '3', '5') [('A', 'C#', 'E')].
	The corresponding score segment has 1 within-label and 2 out-of-label note onsets,
	a ratio of 0.6666666666666666 > 0.6 (the current, arbitrary, threshold).
	If it turns out the label is correct, please add the header of this warning to the IGNORED_WARNINGS, ideally followed
	by a free-text comment in subsequent lines starting with a space or tab.
