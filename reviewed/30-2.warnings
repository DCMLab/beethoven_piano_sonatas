Warnings encountered during the last execution of ms3 review
============================================================

FIRST_BAR_MISSING_TEMPO_MARK_WARNING (29,) ms3.Parse.beethoven_piano_sonatas.30-2
	No metronome mark found in the first measure nor anywhere else in the score.
DCML_NON_CHORD_TONES_ABOVE_THRESHOLD_WARNING (19, 74, '0', '#viio64') ms3.Parse.beethoven_piano_sonatas.30-2
	The label '#viio64' in m. 74, onset 0 (MC 74, onset 0) seems not to correspond well to the score (which does not necessarily mean it is wrong).
	In the context of e.v, it expresses the scale degrees
	('4', '#7', '2') [('E', 'A#', 'C#')].
	The corresponding score segment has 3 within-label and 6 out-of-label note onsets,
	a ratio of 0.6666666666666666 > 0.6 (the current, arbitrary, threshold).
	If it turns out the label is correct, please add the header of this warning to the IGNORED_WARNINGS, ideally followed
	by a free-text comment in subsequent lines starting with a space or tab.
DCML_NON_CHORD_TONES_ABOVE_THRESHOLD_WARNING (19, 76, '3/8', 'vii') ms3.Parse.beethoven_piano_sonatas.30-2
	The label 'vii' in m. 76, onset 3/8 (MC 76, onset 3/8) seems not to correspond well to the score (which does not necessarily mean it is wrong).
	In the context of e.v, it expresses the scale degrees
	('7', 'b2', '4') [('A', 'C', 'E')].
	The corresponding score segment has 1 within-label and 3 out-of-label note onsets,
	a ratio of 0.75 > 0.6 (the current, arbitrary, threshold).
	If it turns out the label is correct, please add the header of this warning to the IGNORED_WARNINGS, ideally followed
	by a free-text comment in subsequent lines starting with a space or tab.
DCML_NON_CHORD_TONES_ABOVE_THRESHOLD_WARNING (19, 80, '3/8', 'ii/bII') ms3.Parse.beethoven_piano_sonatas.30-2
	The label 'ii/bII' in m. 80, onset 3/8 (MC 80, onset 3/8) seems not to correspond well to the score (which does not necessarily mean it is wrong).
	In the context of e.v, it expresses the scale degrees
	('3', 'b5', '7') [('D', 'F', 'A')].

	In the context of e.v, it expresses the scale degrees
	('b7', '3', 'b5') [('Ab', 'D', 'F')].
	The corresponding score segment has 3 within-label and 6 out-of-label note onsets,
