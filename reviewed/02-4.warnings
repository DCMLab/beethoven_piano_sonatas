FIRST_BAR_MISSING_TEMPO_MARK_WARNING (29,) ms3.Parse.beethoven_piano_sonatas.02-4
	No metronome mark found in the first measure nor anywhere else in the score.
DCML_NON_CHORD_TONES_ABOVE_THRESHOLD_WARNING (19, 69, '1/4', 'V6') ms3.Parse.beethoven_piano_sonatas.02-4
	The label 'V6' in m. 68, onset 1/4 (MC 69, onset 1/4) seems not to correspond well to the score (which does not necessarily mean it is wrong).
	In the context of A.bIII, it expresses the scale degrees
	('7', '2', '5') [('B', 'D', 'G')].
	The corresponding score segment has 3 within-label and 7 out-of-label note onsets,
	a ratio of 0.7 > 0.6 (the current, arbitrary, threshold).
	If it turns out the label is correct, please add the header of this warning to the IGNORED_WARNINGS, ideally followed
	by a free-text comment in subsequent lines starting with a space or tab.
