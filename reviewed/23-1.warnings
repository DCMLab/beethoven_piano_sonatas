============================================================

FIRST_BAR_MISSING_TEMPO_MARK_WARNING (29,) ms3.Parse.beethoven_piano_sonatas.23-1
	No metronome mark found in the first measure nor anywhere else in the score.
DCML_NON_CHORD_TONES_ABOVE_THRESHOLD_WARNING (19, 139, '3/4', 'viio64/V') ms3.Parse.beethoven_piano_sonatas.23-1
	The label 'viio64/V' in m. 138, onset 3/4 (MC 139, onset 3/4) seems not to correspond well to the score (which does not necessarily mean it is wrong).
	In the context of f.i, it expresses the scale degrees
	('1', '#4', '#6') [('F', 'B', 'D')].
	The corresponding score segment has 5 within-label and 8 out-of-label note onsets,
	a ratio of 0.6153846153846154 > 0.6 (the current, arbitrary, threshold).
	If it turns out the label is correct, please add the header of this warning to the IGNORED_WARNINGS, ideally followed
	by a free-text comment in subsequent lines starting with a space or tab.
