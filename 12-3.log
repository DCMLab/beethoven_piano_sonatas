Attempting to parse 12-3.mscx
MC 1 seems to be a pickup measure but has not been excluded from bar count!
The endRepeat in MC 39 (1) is not adapted to the irregular measure length in MC 1 (1/4)
Done parsing 12-3.mscx

Failed to expand labels due to syntactic errors:
Can only use .str accessor with string values!
