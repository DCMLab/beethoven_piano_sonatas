Attempting to parse 03-3.mscx
MC 1 seems to be a pickup measure but has not been excluded from bar count!
MC 18 is completing MC 17 but has not been excluded from bar count!
MC 66 (3/8) and MC 67 (3/4) don't add up to 3/4.
The endRepeat in MC 75 (3/4) is not adapted to the irregular measure length in MC 1 (3/8)
MC 109 (3/8) and MC 110 (3/4) don't add up to 3/4.
Done parsing 03-3.mscx
