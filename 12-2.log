MC 1 seems to be a pickup measure but has not been excluded from bar count!
MC 18 is completing MC 17 but has not been excluded from bar count!
MC 70 is completing MC 69 but has not been excluded from bar count!
MC 79 is completing MC 78 but has not been excluded from bar count!
MC 18 is completing MC 95 but has not been excluded from bar count!
