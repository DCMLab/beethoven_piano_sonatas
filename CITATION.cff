type: dataset
abstract: >-
  <jats:p>This corpus of annotated MuseScore files has been created within the DCML
  corpus initiative and employs the DCML harmony annotation standard. It is
  one out of nine similar corpora that have been grouped together to "An
  Annotated Corpus of Tonal Piano Music from the Long 19th Century" which comes
  with a data report: https://doi.org/10.18061/emr.v18i1.8903</jats:p>

  abstract: >-
    <jats:p>We present a dataset of 264 annotated piano pieces of nine
    composers, composed in the long 19th century
    (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7483349). Annotations adhere to the DCML
    harmony annotation standard and include Roman numerals, phrase boundaries,
    and cadence types. The scores are encoded in the XML-based MuseScore 3
    format. Annotations are embedded within the MuseScore files. In addition,
    all harmony information, alongside key features of the encoded measure and
    note objects, is provided in the form of plaintext TSV-formatted tables for
    increased interoperability with other datasets and analysis tools.
    Annotations were collaboratively created and reviewed by a pool of trained
    music theorists. Collaboration took place asynchronously online via a
    semi-automated GitHub-based workflow designed for quality assurance,
    allowing cycles of revisions and reviews until consensus is reached. The
    full revision history is retained, providing data for further empirical
    research on inter-annotator agreement and related topics. We also present
    descriptive statistics about the nine corpora and the dataset as a whole,
    including comparisons of pitch-class contents, phrase lengths, modulations,
    and cadence types. We conclude with a discussion of our musicological
    principles for corpus building and considerations of
    representability.</jats:p>
